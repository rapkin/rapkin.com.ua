![Snake on coffeescript](/assets/img/game_page.png)

To learn CoffeeScript I started writing a little game. [Demo here!][demo]

The development process was very interesting and I was so carried away that even decided to finish the backend for the game. After this I wrote a term paper (which successfully defended), the text is here: [My term paper][term-paper].

Source code for the entire project [on github][snake-github]. You can build game with instruction and play.
